## Getting started
Once you've downloaded this repo, simply set the GOPATH to be the root of the repository,
then you can build stuff using the go toolchain (regardless of what directory you're in).

```shell
export GOPATH=/home/myuser/
go test wordchain    # Runs the wordchain unit tests
go build wordchain   # Builds the wordchain binary in the local directory
```
